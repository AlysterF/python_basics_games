## Basic Games in Python 3

This was one of my first experiences in Python 3 and I've never shared the scripts in any of my repositories. So I've decided to keep it here, specially to track my studies in the programming language since the beginning.

Soon, I'll add other scripts that I had the pleasure to write in my Python learning path and never shared. I've learned a lot with them and I'm sure it can help the beginners a lot also.

If you are starting with Python 3, I hope these scripts help you in some way.
